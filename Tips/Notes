main function should be the main one and does not have any arguments. The main should be first as flutter looks for it.
functions are called as function_name();
but the main function need not be called because flutter itself calls it.
To bring your code to the screen in main function you need to use a widget and bring the widget to your function. 

Creating a root widget :-
a widget is nothing but an object for which we need a class to define the blueprint of the widget or in other terms object ( java way )
Also a class used to create a widget needs to have some features in order for flutter to know it is a class for a widget and that needs to be displayed on to the screen. So we make the class inherit from a base class -which comes from the flutter framework. 
That base class coming from the flutter framework needs to be imported { import 'package:flutter/name'} this package consists of the base clsases we want. 
Build method is important to be there in a class. Flutter calls build so it should be available in our code that needs to be displayed. It comes under statelesswidget class which comes with the fluttr package.

A widget created by us always needs to return an other widget in the build method until we reach a widget that ship with flutter.

The widgeting can be seein in materialapp constructor as we keep adding an element and then a built-in widget for that element and go on. 
After that also we will not be able to display it all on the screen unless we make a few changes to the main method.

In the main function :- runApp(this argument must be a widget, this widget is the one we built using baseclass() )
